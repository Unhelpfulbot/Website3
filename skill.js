When I worked on Upon Them, it was my first time coding but the code for the main turn function correctly but I was unable to adapt the code to account for the multiplayer aspect. After learning from my failure in creating Upon Them, I expanded my knowledge of fundementals in game code and created TerroRise with scripts for many different actions.",

In the course, I was taught the basics about python which I implemented to build my first discord bot. When building the discord bot, I used the python extension discord.py and multiple time related extension to build a timer which gives alerts at certain times and display information when a reaction is given.",

I used Arduino IDE for my RPI class project, where we created a plant maintenance device that help keep plants alive. The device uses a arduino to control the device and to gather information from the sensors. The board also gets wireless signials from the Arduino Cloud which updates the condition variables or the output sources on the board.",

I learned how to operate the: Lathe, Drill Press, Vertical Mill, Horizontal Mill, Band Saw, Polisher, Plastic and Metal Wielding. I learned how to operate all of these machines when I was tasked to create a toy cannon for the class. The barrel of the cannon uses the Lathe. While the base uses the Vertical Mill, Horizontal Mill, and Band saw. While both of the part uses a Drill Press and Polisher. In addition to the toy cannon project, machining was also used in my marshmallow laucnher project.",
