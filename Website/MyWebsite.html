                    bacheleors in Mechnaical Engineering. Although I am trying to become an Engineer, I am willing to
                    learn all types of skills to help me become more skillful. I am currently learning coding languages 
                    during my free time as I find coding fun and closely related to engineering. In addition, one day I want to
                    recreate and improve a game I played duuring my Elementary school years, Graal Online ERA. While my
                    main goal is to be a successful engineer that can improve living standards and solve global issues
                    with my innovations.

                    for the Fall of 2023 or Spring of 2024 term. I am interested in oppurtunities related to programming or engineering.
                    The ideal engineering industries for me are automative and robotics. While for programming, I am
                    seeking to improve my coding fundementals as I only have basic knowledge of the current coding languages I know. However,
                    I am also willing to work in other industries as long as I can gain new skills or improve on my current skills.

                    on a few small projects that are simple but functions the way I wanted the web to function. Certification below:</P>

                    <div class="starthidden marg" id="C#"> <P> I began learning C# for fun over the summer of 2021, as I tried to create
                    games in Unity. Although I successfully followed tutorial to understand the basic for character control and different properties. I was unable
                    to create a functional game at the time. The first game I created worked but was filled with problems which was not what I desired.
                    The second game I created function way smoother and through designing game, for my own interest, I learned the basic for 2D game creation 
                    and how to code in C#.</P> </div>
                    <div class="starthidden marg" id="Python"> <P> I learnt Python during my time at the City College of New York. We were taught about basic
                        usage of variables, functions, loops, arrays, and so on. Using the knowledge of python I learnt I decided to challenge myself and create
                    a discord bot that serves little to no purpose. </P></div>
                    <div class="starthidden marg" id="SolidWorks"> <p> I learnt SolidWorks during my time a City College of New York. In the class I took we learnt how
                        make sketches like blue prints of an object. Then we learnt how to make the object that was sketch using Solidworks. We learn about how to extrude a 2D
                        shape to a 3D shapes or to make curvatures, wires, intrusions, shells, planes, mirroring, pattern, screws, and many more. Ultimately in the class I was able to design a hand mixer.  
                    </p></div>
                    <div class="starthidden marg" id="Workshop Machinary"> I learnt how to use workshop michanary at my time at Rensselear Polytechnical Insitute. During the class,
                        we had to create a cannon or a train. My partner and I, we did work in pairs, decided to both make a cannon. We were taught the basic of the Lathe, Vertical Mill,
                        Drill press, Horizontal Mill, Band saw, polisher. In addition, we were taught about metal welding, non-metal welding, and laser cutting. But most importantly
                        how to safely used these equipments. Ultimately to finish the project, my partner and I needed to learn the tool together through reading the lab manual.
